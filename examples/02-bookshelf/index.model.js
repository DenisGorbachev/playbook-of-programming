/**
 * Hypothesis: typify the program as a set of pairs of user's mental images
 *
 * 1. Define specific pairs using "batched cursor" method
 * 1. Construct a generator of all possible mental images (mental field) of the program [A complete description of the infinite set of pairs of mental images]
 *   1. If can't construct: go back to previous step (get more pairs)
 *   1. Test the generator by making sure that it can generate hand-written pairs
 * 1. Construct a program:
 *   1. If can't construct: narrow down the list of supported cases (mental image pairs)
 *   1. Test the program by making sure that it can generate all cases produced by generator
